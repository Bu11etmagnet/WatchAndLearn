# Watch and learn

[Watch and learn](WatchAndLearn.md) - a collection of presentations about programming, almost exclusively related to C++

If there is an overlap with [SG20 Education and Recommended Videos for Teaching C++](https://www.cjdb.com.au/sg20-and-videos),
I claim it to be because great minds think alike :)
