## Scott Meyers

|Event|Presenter| Title | Link | Comment |
|-----|-------|-------|------|---------|
|code::dive 2014 | Scott Meyers | Cpu Caches and Why You Care | <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE> | If you want performance, know your hardware.
| CppCon 2014 | Scott Meyers | Type Deduction and Why You Care | <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQxj20X-tIU> | Includes the Scott Meyers Hair Poll. A quote from the talk: "If you want a completely portable, 100% standards-conformant way to get the **wrong answer**, this is what you want." |
|?| Scott Meyers | Why C++ Sails When the Vasa Sank | <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vyh1APsMAE> | A description of C++, its features and strengths |

(A quote from the talk:
> Tom Cargill wrote in 1990: [[you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor, and when was the last time you needed one?](https://boardofwisdom.com/togo/Quotes/ShowQuote?msgid=214625|If)]  
> And it is very sad, because when I read this I went "Hmm, well OK, that means this:"

    class Base {
    private: virtual ~Base() = 0;
    //       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    };
    class Derived() : protected virtual Base { ... };
    //                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> I mean I knew immediately what he was talking about, which really is so sad.
> And I have never needed one.
)

Another quote:
> When you have a programming language that is one of the top two-three-four programming languages **for twenty-five years**, it's gotta be doing something right.

And another:
> [U.S. National Laboratory] was the first place I ever ran into people who talked about CPU-months.
